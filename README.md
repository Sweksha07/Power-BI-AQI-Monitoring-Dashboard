# Power-BI-AQI-Monitoring-Dashboard
Developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze AQI data for Indian cities. Created line charts to track AQI trends across different cities. Used cards to display key metrics for pollutants (SOâ‚‚, CO, PM2.5, NO). Mapped AQI distribution to visualize pollution levels geographically.
